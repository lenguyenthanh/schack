# schack
S(cala)ch(ess)ack

An experiment to implement chess logic in Scala 3.

## Inspiration

- scalachess
- compression
- shakmaty

## Goal

- Use Bitboards to represent chess position
  - support moves generator
  - validate chess position
- Support compression library out of the box
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to extend functionality
- Balance between speed & code cleaness & usability

### Wishlist

- detect whether a move is a check or taking a piece
- calculate all possible moves
- allow for non-standard moves like EnPassant and castling
